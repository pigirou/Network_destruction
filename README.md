# Network_destruction

This repository includes a program written in Python that implements two different algorithms to destroy a network of people that are most likely to transmit Covid - 19 to a lot of people. 

We create a network of nodes that represents the people likely to transmit Covid - 19. There are links between all nodes that communicate with each other in real life. 

We can either choose  the node with the largest amount of links each time, or calculate the "Collective Influence" of each node. The node with the largest CI is the one that we choose to vaccinate.
